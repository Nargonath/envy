> Load environment variables from a file

Similar to packages like [dotenv](https://npmjs.com/package/dotenv), but with improved safety and security. And strong tests to prove it.

*Looking for the old `envy` that reads JSON? See [eliOcs/node-envy](https://github.com/eliOcs/node-envy).*

## Why?

 - Safest environment loader around.
 - Ensures file permissions are secure.
 - No side effects, does not modify [`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env).
 - Returns property names in [camelCase](https://github.com/sindresorhus/camelcase).

## Install

```sh
npm install envy --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const envy = require('envy');
```

Load the environment variables.

```js
const env = envy();
// {
//     foo : 'bar'
// }
```

A `.env.example` file is used as a template to determine which environment variables are required by your application. This file should be commited to your repository.

```sh
# .env.example
FOO=
```

A `.env` file is used to provide the actual environment values. You should add this file to a local [`.gitignore`](https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files).

```sh
# .env
FOO=bar
```

Environment files look just like normal shell files (e.g. `.bashrc` and friends). Values with spaces may be optionally wrapped in `'` single quotes. This is recommended for shell compatibility.

```sh
# This is a comment.
FOO=bar
SENTENCE='Hi, there!'
```

After assembling the environment from `.env` and [`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env), it is filtered by a union of the properties in `.env` and `.env.example`. In other words, variables defined in either file will be returned and variables not defined in either file will be ignored. This is done to prevent surprising behavior, since `process.env` often contains a wide variety of variables, some of which are implicitly set without the user's direct knowledge. It is better to be explicit about the variables you use, which improves safety and debugging.

## Tip

We recommend using [joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) to further validate and parse the returned values.

A common setup would be:

```js
// cli.js
const meow = require('meow');
const envy = require('envy');
const joi = require('joi');

const cli = meow();

const config = Object.assign({}, envy(), cli.flags);
const { error, value } = joi.validate(config, {
    port : joi.number().positive().integer().min(0).max(65535)
});
if (error) {
    throw error;
}
// value.port has been parsed as a number
console.log('port:', value.port);
```
```sh
# .env.example
PORT=
```
```sh
# .env
PORT=1000
```

```console
$ node cli.js
port: 1000
$ PORT=2000 node cli.js
port: 2000
$ node cli.js --port=3000
port: 3000
$ PORT=2000 node cli.js --port=3000
port: 3000
```

## API

### envy(filepath)

Returns an `object` with environment variables derived from [`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_process_env) and the contents at `filepath`. If a variable is defined in both places, `process.env` takes precedence so that users can easily override values on the command line. If all required variables are present in `process.env`, then the `.env` file need not exist. All property names are returned in camelcase.

#### filepath

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `.env`

Path to the file where environment variables are kept. Must be [hidden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_file_and_hidden_directory#macOS) (start with a `.`). Will also be used to compute the path of the example file (by appending `.example`).
